# Five Lessons from Building with AI ⚡

Over the past few months, I've been experimenting with AI tools in real-world projects.  
Here are five lessons I’ve learned:

## 1. Start Small
Begin with a narrow use-case. Let the pipeline grow with your needs.

## 2. Automate Validation
Every input (whether human or machine) needs validation.  
Our **Lambda frontmatter checks** are a good example.

## 3. Watch Your Costs
Cloud services are powerful but they scale quickly — in usage *and* in bills.  
Keep budgets visible from day one.

## 4. Humans Stay in the Loop
AI can accelerate, but decisions with risk or nuance should still be human-reviewed.

## 5. Iterate Relentlessly
The best systems evolve. Release, observe, refine, repeat.
