Religion has long played a role in helping people cope with anxiety and uncertainty. For many, faith provides a sense of meaning, community, and hope during difficult times.

**How Religion Can Help with Anxiety:**
- **Rituals and Prayer:** Offer structure and comfort.
- **Community Support:** Reduces feelings of isolation.
- **Belief in a Higher Power:** Provides reassurance and perspective.
- **Moral Framework:** Guides decision-making and reduces existential anxiety.

However, the relationship between religion and anxiety is complex. While faith can be a source of strength, it can also contribute to guilt or fear in some cases. Understanding this dynamic is important for mental health professionals and individuals alike.
