Mindset refers to the beliefs and attitudes we hold about ourselves and our abilities. Psychologist Carol Dweck identified two main types: fixed mindset (believing abilities are static) and growth mindset (believing abilities can be developed).

**Why Mindset Matters:**
- **Growth Mindset:** Encourages learning, resilience, and embracing challenges.
- **Fixed Mindset:** Leads to avoidance of difficulty and fear of failure.

Research shows that cultivating a growth mindset can improve academic achievement, career success, and well-being. By changing how we think about effort and failure, we unlock our potential for growth and transformation.
