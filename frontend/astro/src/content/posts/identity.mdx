Identity is the answer to the question, "Who am I?" It encompasses our beliefs, values, experiences, and social roles. Psychologists study identity to understand how we develop a sense of self and how it shapes our interactions with the world.

**Key Aspects of Identity:**
- **Personal Identity:** Unique traits and life story.
- **Social Identity:** Group memberships (e.g., nationality, religion, profession).
- **Cultural Identity:** Shared customs, language, and traditions.

Identity is not fixedâ€”it evolves over time as we encounter new experiences and challenges. A strong sense of identity can foster confidence and resilience, while identity confusion may lead to anxiety or social difficulties. Exploring identity is a lifelong journey that influences every aspect of our lives.
